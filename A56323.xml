            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

The grievances being removed, our affections will carry us with ſpeed and cheerefulneſſe, to give His Majeſtie that which may be ſufficient both for his honour and ſupport. Thoſe that in firſt place ſhal endeavour to redreſſe the grievances, will be found not to hinder, but to be the furtherers of his Majeſties ſervice: hee that takes away weights, doth as much advantage motion, as hee that addeth wings.</p>

            <p>In the firſt (hee ſaid) hee would offer them the ſeverall heads of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> ſome principall grievances, under which the Kingdome groaned.</p>
            <p>In the ſecond, he undertooke to prove, that the diſorders from <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> whence thoſe grievances iſſued, were as hartfull to the King as to the people.</p>
            <p>In the third, he would adviſe ſ<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ch a way of healing and remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> thoſe grievances, as might be equally effectual to maintaine the honour and greatneſſe of the King, and to procure the proſperity and contentment of the people.</p>
            <p>In the handling whereof he promiſed to uſe ſuch expreſſions as might mitigate the ſh<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

It is a great Prerogative to the K. and a great honour attributed to him in a Maxime of our Law, that he can doe no wrong, he is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of Iuſtied, and if there be any injuſtice in the execution of his Commands, the Law caſts it upon the Miniſters, and frees the King. Activity, life, and vigour, are conveied into the ſublunary creatures, by the influence of Heaven: but the malignity and diſtemper, the c<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uſe, of ſo many Epidemicall diſeaſes, do proceed from the noy ſome vapours of the earth, or ſome ill affected qualities of the aire, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any infection or alteration of thoſe pure, celeſtiall and incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible bodies. In the like manner (he ſaid) the authority, the power and countenance of Princes may concurre in the actions of evill men, without partaking in the injuſtice and obliquitie of them. <note place="margin">Hurtfull projects pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſented to the King under plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> Theſe matters where of we complaine, have bin preſented to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie, either under the pretence of Royall Pretogatives, which he is bound to maintaine, or of publike good, which is the moſt honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble object of Regall wiſdome. But the covetous and ambitious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes of others, have interpoſed betwixt his Royall intentions, and the happines of his people, making thoſe things pernicious and hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, which his Majeſtie apprehended as juſt, and profitable.</p>
            <p>He ſaid, the things which he was to propound, were of a various <note place="margin">A promiſe of modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> nature, many of them ſuch as required a very tender and exquiſite conſideration, In handling of which, as he would be bold to uſe the liberty of the place and relation wherein he ſtood, ſo hee would bee carefull to expreſſe that Modeſtie and humilitie, which might be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected by thoſe, of whoſe actions he was to ſpeake. And if his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; or his tongue ſhould ſlip into a particular miſtake, hee would <note place="margin">Submiſſion to reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> not thinke it ſo great a ſhame, to faile by his owne weakneſſe, as hee
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:102464:3"/>
ſhould eſteem it an honour and advantage, to be corrected by the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of that houſe, to w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> he ſubmitted himſelfe, with this proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that he deſired no reformation ſo much as to reforme himſelfe.</p>
            <p>The greateſt liberty of the kingdom, is Religion; thereby we are <note place="margin">Religion.</note> ſteed from ſpiritual evils: and no impoſitions are ſo grievous, as thoſe that are laid upon the ſoule. The next great libert<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, is Juſtice, wherby <note place="margin">Iuſtice.</note> we are preſerved from injurie in our perſons, and eſtates, from this is derived into the Common-wealth, peace, and order, and ſafety, and when this is interrupted, confuſion and danger are ready to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelme all. The third great liberty conſiſts in the power and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge of Parliaments, this is the fountaine of law, the great Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell <note place="margin">Priviledge of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> of the kingdom, the higheſt Court: this is inabled by the Legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative and Conciliary power, to prevent evils to come; by the Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciary power, to ſuppreſſe and remove evils preſent. If you conſider theſe three great liberties in the order of dignitie, this laſt is inferiour to the other two as meanes are inferour to the end; but if you conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them in the order of neceſſity <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd uſe, this may juſtly claime the <note place="margin">The order propounded in handling theſe three great liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</note> firſt place, in our care, becauſe the end cannot be obtained without the means: if we do not preſerve this, we cannot long hope to enjoy either of the other. Therefore (he ſaid) being to ſpeak of thoſe grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances which lye upon the kingdome, he would obſerve this order.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. To mention thoſe, which were againſt the priviledge of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments.</item>
               <item>2. Thoſe which were prejudiciall to the Religion eſtabliſhed in the Kingdome.</item>
               <item>3. Thoſe which did interrupt the juſtice of the Realme, in the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of our perſons, and propriety of our eſtates.</item>
            </list>
            <p>The priviledges of Parliament were not given for the ornament <note place="margin">The neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie &amp; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Parliament.</note> or advantage of thoſe, who are the members of Parliament, they have a reall uſe and efficacy, towards that which is the end of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: we are free from ſuits, that we may the more intirely addict our ſelves, to the publike ſervices: we have therfore liberty of ſpeech, that our Counſels may not bee corrupted with feare, or our judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments perverted with ſelfe reſpects: thoſe three great faculties and functions of Parliament, the Legiſlative Judiciary, and Conſiliary power, can not be well exerciſed without ſuch priviledges as theſe. The wiſdome of our Lawes, the faithfulneſſe of our Counſels, the righteouſneſſe of our judgments can hardly be kept pure and untain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, if they proceed from diſtracted and reſtramed mindes.</p>
            <p>It is a good Rule of the Morall Philoſopher, <hi>Et non laed as mentem gubernatricem omnium actionum:</hi> Theſe powers of Parliament are
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:102464:4"/>
to the body politike as the rationall faculties of the ſoule, to a man. That which keepes all the parts of the Common-wealth in frame, and temper, ought to be moſt carefully preſerved in that freedome, vigour, and activity, which belongs to it ſelfe. Our predeceſſors in this houſe, have ever bin moſt carefull in the firſt place, to ſettle and ſecure their priviledges: and (he ſaid) he hoped that we having had greater breaches made upon us than heretofore, would bee no leſſe tender of them, and forward in ſeeking reparation for that which is paſt, and prevention of the like for the time to come.</p>
            <p>Then he propounded diverſe particular points wherein the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge <note place="margin">Particular breaches of priviledge 1 Reſtraint of ſpeech. 2 Interdict of queſtions</note> of Parliament had bin broken.</p>
            <p>Firſt, in reſtraiaing the members of the Houſe from ſpeaking.</p>
            <p>Secondly, in forbidding the Speaker to put any Queſtion.</p>
            <p>Theſe two were practiſed the laſt day of the laſt Parliament (and, as was alledged, by his Majeſties command) and both of them trench upon the very life and being of Parliaments, for if ſuch a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining power as this ſhould take root, and be admitted, it will be impoſſible for us to bring any reſolution to perfection in ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters as ſhall diſpleaſe thoſe about the King.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, by impriſoning diverſe Members of the Houſe for mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters <note place="margin">Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of members. Iudiciall proceedings Order to be bound to the good behaviour.</note> done in Pa<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Fourthly, by indictments, informations, and judgments in ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary &amp; inferiour courts for ſpeeches &amp; proceedings in Parliaments</p>

               </gap>racefull order of the Kings Bench, whereby ſome members of this Houſe were injoyned to put in ſecurity of the good behaviour, and for refuſall thereof, they were continued in priſon, diverſe yeares, without any particular allegation againſt them: one of them was freed by death, others not diſmiſſed till his Majeſtie had declared his intention, to ſummon this Parliament. And this he noted not onely as a breach of priviledge, but as a violation of the common juſtice of the Kingdome.</p>
            <p>Sixthly by the ſudden and abrupt diſſolution of Parliaments, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary <note place="margin">Abrupt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions of <hi>Parliament.</hi>
               </note> to the Law and cuſtome. It hath bin often declared in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that the Parliament ſhould not be diſſolved, till the petitions bee anſwered. This (hee ſaid) was a great grievance, becauſe it doth prevent the redreſſe of other grievances. It were a hard caſe, that a private man ſhould bee put to death without being heard: As this repreſentative body of the Commons, receives a being by the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, ſo it receives a civill death by the diſſolution. Is it not a much more heavie doome, by which we loſe our being, and have this civill death inflicted on us, in diſpleaſure, and not to be allowed time and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:102464:4"/>
liberty to anſwer for our ſelves? that we ſhould not only dye, but have this marke of infamy laid upon us, to be made <hi>Inteſtabiles,</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to make our wils, to diſpoſe of our buſines, as this Houſe hath alwayes uſed to do, before Adjournments or diſſolutions? yet this, hath often bin our caſe, we have not bin permitted to powre out our laſt ſighes and groanes, into the boſome of our deare Soveraigne, the words of dying men are full of piercing affections<hi>:</hi> if we might be heard to ſpeak, no doubt we ſhold ſo fully expreſſe our love, &amp; faith fulnes to our Prince, as might take off the falſe ſuggeſtions &amp; aſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of others: at leaſt we ſhould in our humble ſupplications, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend ſome ſuch things to him in the name of his people as would make for his honour, and the publike good of his Kingdome.</p>
            <p>Thus he concluded the firſt ſort of grievances, being ſuch as were <note place="margin">Grievances concerning Religion.</note> againſt the priviledge of Parliament, and paſſed on to the next, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Religion: all which he conveyed under the foure heads.</p>
            <p n="1">1 The firſt, was the great incouragement given to popery, of <note place="margin">Incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery. Suſpenſion of Lawes.</note> which he produced theſe particular evidences.</p>
            <p n="1">1 A ſuſpenſion of all Lawes againſt Papiſts, whereby they enjoy a free, and almoſt publike exerciſe of that Rel<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>gion, and thoſe good Statutes which were made for reſtraint of Idolatry, and ſuperſtition, are now a ground of ſecurity to them, in the practice of both, being uſed to no other end, but to get money into the Kings purſe: which as it is clearely againſt the intentions of the Law, ſo it is full of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe to the Kingdome.</p>
            <p>By this means a dangerous partie is cheriſhed, and increaſed, who are ready to cloſe with any opportunitie or diſturbing the peace and ſafety of the State. Yet (he ſaid) he did not deſire any new lawes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt popery, or any rigorous courſes in the execution of thoſe alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in force; he was far from ſeeking the ruine of their perſons or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, onely hee wiſht they might bee kept in ſuch a condition, as ſhould reſtraine them from doing hurt.</p>
            <p>It may be objected, there are moderate and diſcreet men amongſt <note place="margin">There can be no ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity from papiſts.</note> them, men of eſtates, ſuch as have an intereſt in the peace and proſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>perity of the Kingdome, as well as we. Theſe (he ſaid) were not to be conſidered according to their owne diſpoſition, but according to <note place="margin">but In their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability.</note> the nature of the body, whereof they are parties. The Planets have ſeverall and particular motions of their owne, yet they are all rapt and tranſported into a contrary courſe, by the ſuperior Orbe which comprehends them all. The Principles of Popery are ſuch, as are incompatible with any other RELIGION: there may bee a ſuſpenſion of violence, for ſome by reſpects,

but the ultimate end, even of that moderation, is, that they may with more advantage extirpate that which is oppoſite to them. Laws will not reſtraine them, oaths will not, the Pope can diſpence with both theſe, and where there is occaſion, his command wil act them, to the diſturbance of the Realme, againſt their owne private diſpoſition, yea, againſt their own reaſon and judgment to obey him, to whom they have (eſpecially the Jeſuiticall party) abſolutely and intirely obliged themſelves, not only in ſpirituall matters, but in temporall, as they are in order <hi>ad Spiritualia. H.</hi> the 3<hi rend="sup">d.</hi> and <hi>H.</hi> the 4<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> were no Proteſtants themſelves, yet were murthered, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they tolerated the Proteſtants, by which and many other preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents it appeares, that the King, that the Kingdome can have no ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity but in their weakneſſe and diſabilite to doe hurt.</p>
            <p n="2">2 A 2<hi rend="sup">d.</hi> incouragement is, their admiſſion into places of power <note place="margin">Admiſſion into places of power.</note> and truſt in the Common-wealth, whereby they get many depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants and adherents, not only of their own, but even of ſuch as make profeſſion to be proteſtants.</p>
            <p n="3">3 A third, their freedome of reſorting to <hi>London,</hi> and the Court, <note place="margin">Free reſort to London &amp; the court</note> whereby they have opportunity, not only of Communicating their Counſels, and deſignes one to another, but of diving into his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Counſels, by the frequent acceſſe of thoſe who are active men, amongſt them, to the tables and company of great men, and under ſubtile pretences and diſguiſes, they want not meanes of cheriſhing their owne projects, and of indeavouring to mould and biaſſe the publike affaires to the great advantage of that partie.</p>
            <p n="4">4 A 4<hi rend="sup">th,</hi> that as they have a Congregation of Cardinals at <hi>Rome,</hi> to conſider of the apteſt wayes and means of eſtabliſhing the Popes authority and Religion in <hi>England:</hi> ſo they have a Nuncio here, to act and diſpoſe that party to the execution of thoſe Counſels, and by the aſſ<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſtance of ſuch cunning and Jeſuiticall ſpirits as ſwarm in this towne, to order and mannage all actions, and events, to the furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of that maine end.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The ſecond grievance in Religion, was from thoſe manifold in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novations lately introduced into ſeverall parts of the Kingdome, all <note place="margin">Innovations in matters of Religion</note> inclining to Popery, and diſpoſing and fitting men to entertaine it: the particulars are theſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Divers of the chiefeſt points of Religion in difference betwixt <note place="margin">Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of po<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>piſh tenets.</note> us and the Papiſts have bin publikely defended in licenſed Books, in Sermons, in Vniverſity acts and diſputations.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Diverſe Popiſh Ceremonies have bin not only practiſed, but <note place="margin">Practice of popiſh cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies.</note> countenanced, yea little leſſe than injoyned, as Altars, Images, Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifixes,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:102464:6"/>
bowings, and other geſtures and obſervances, which put upon our Churches a ſhape and face of popery. He compared this to the dry bones in <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> firſt they came together, then the ſinewes and the fleſh came upon them, after this the skin covered them, and then breath and life was put into them: ſo (he ſaid) after theſe men had moulded us into an outward forme and viſage of popery, they would more boldly endeavour to breath into us the ſpirit &amp; life of popery.</p>
            <p n="3">3 The third grievance, was the countenancing and preferring thoſe <note place="margin">Preferment of men po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſhly incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Diſcourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of true profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors.

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rs were ſo well knowne, that they needed not to be named.</p>
            <p n="4">4 The fourth was, the diſcouragement of thoſe who were known to be moſt conſcionable, and faithfull profeſſors of the truth: ſome of the wayes of effecting this, he obſerved to be theſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1 The courſes taken to inforce and inlarge thoſe unhappy differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, for matters of ſmall moment, which have bin amongſt our ſelves, and to raiſe up new occaſions of further diviſion, wherby many have bin induced to forſake the land, not ſeeing the end of thoſe volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and humane Injunctions in things appertaining to <hi>Gods</hi> worſhip: whereas thoſe who are indeed lovers of Religion, and of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of God, would ſeeke to make up thoſe breaches, and to unite us more entirely againſt the common enemy.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The over rigid proſecution of thoſe who are ſcrupulous in uſing <note place="margin">Over-rigid proſecution of the ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous for things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different.</note> ſome things enjoyned, which are held by thoſe who enjoyn them, to be in themſelves indifferent. It hath bin ever the deſire of this Houſe, expreſt in many Parliaments in Q. <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time and ſince, that ſuch might be renderly uſed. It was one of our petitions delivered at <hi>Oxford</hi> to his Majeſtie that now is: but what little moderation it hath produced, is not unknowne to us all, any other vice almoſt <note place="margin">Vnjuſt pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments for matters not by law. Reading the Booke. The Table ſet Altar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. Comming to the railes Preaching upon the Lords day. Varying from the catechiſme. Abuſe of Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</note> may be better indured in a Miniſter than Inconformitie.</p>
            <p n="3">3 The unjuſt puniſhments, and vexations of ſundry perſons for matters required, without any warrant of Law: as</p>
            <p>For not reading the book <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oncerning recreation on the Lords day.</p>
            <p>For not removing the Communion Table to bee ſet Altarwiſe at the Eaſt end of the Chancell.</p>
            <p>For not comming up to the Railes to receive the Sacrament.</p>
            <p>For preaching the Lords day in the afternoone.</p>
            <p>For Catechiſing in any other words and manner than in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe words of the ſhort catechiſme in the Common Prayer booke.</p>
            <p>The fifth and laſt grievance concerning Religion, was the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachment and abuſe of Eccleſiaſticall juriſdiction: the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars mentioned are theſe.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:102464:7"/>
1 Fining and impriſoning in caſes not allowed by Law.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Their challenging their juriſdiction to be appropriate to their <note place="margin">In fining &amp; impriſoning Claiming juriſdiction to be <hi>Iure Divine.</hi> Articles of the Viſitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> order, which they alledge to be <hi>jure Divine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3 The contriving and publiſhing of new articles, upon which they inforce the Churchwardens to take oathes, and to make inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and preſentments, as if ſuch articles had the force of Canons: and this, he ſaid, was an effect of great preſumption and boldneſſe, not only in the Biſhops, but in their Archdeacons, Officials and Chancellors, taking upon themſelves a kind of Synodall authority: and the Injunctions of this kinde, might well partake in name with that part of the common Law, which is called the Extravagants.</p>
            <p>Having diſpatcht theſe ſeverall points, hee proceeded to the third <note place="margin">Grievances concerning the liberty of perſons and eſtates.</note> part of grievances, being ſuch as are againſt the common juſtice of the Realm, in the liberties of our perſons, and proprietie of our eſtates, of which (he ſaid) he had many to propound: In doing whereof, he would rather obſerve the order of time, wherein they were acted, than of conſequence: but when hee ſhould come to the cure, hee ſhould then perſwade the Houſe to begin with thoſe, who were of moſt importance, as being now in execution, and very much preſſing and exhauſting the Common-Wealth.</p>
            <p>He began with the Tonnage and poundage, and other impoſitions <note place="margin">Tonnage &amp; Poundage impoſitions</note> not warranted by Law: and becauſe theſe burdens had long lyen upon us, and the principles which produced them, are the ſame from whence diverſe others are derived, he thought it neceſſary to promiſe a ſhort narrative, and relation of the grounds and proceed<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ngs of the power of impoſing herein practiſed. It was (he ſaid) a fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall <note place="margin">Not to be taken but by conſent in <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>

               </gap> this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, an hereditary liberty and priviledge of all the free borne ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the Land, that no tax, tallage, or other charge might be laid upon us, without common conſent in Parliament, this was acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by the Conqueror, ratified in that contract which hee made <note place="margin">Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by the <hi>Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror.</hi> Sometimes broken by other Kings but never denyed.

               </note> with this Nation, upon his admittance to the Kingdome, declared and confirmed in the Lawes which he publiſhed.</p>
            <p>This hath never bin denyed to any of our Kings, though broken and interrupted by ſome of them, eſpecially by K. <hi>Iohn,</hi> and <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. then againe confirmed by <hi>Mag.

            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:102464:7"/>
He obſerved that thoſe Kings, even in the Acts whereby they did <note place="margin">Some mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for the ſubject in theſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry breaches.</note> break the Law, did really affirme the ſubjects liberty, and diſclaime that right of impoſing, which is nowchale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged, for they did uſually procure the Merchants conſent, to ſuch taxes as were laid, therby to put a colour of juſtice upon their proceeding, and ordinarily they were limited to a ſhort time, and then propounded to the ratifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Parliament,</hi> where they were cancell'd or confirmed, as the neceſſity and ſtate of the Kingdome did require.</p>
            <p>But for the moſt part, ſuch charges upon merchandize, were taken <note place="margin">The grant by Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment moſt uſuall.</note> by authority of <hi>Parliament,</hi> and granted for ſome ſhort time, in a greater or leſſer proportion, as was requiſite for ſupply of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like occaſions, 6 or 12 in the pound, for one, two, or three yeers, as they ſaw cauſe, to be imployed for the defence of the Sea, and it was acknowledged ſo clearly, to be in the power of <hi>arliament,</hi> that they <note place="margin">At firſt vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of time and perſons Afterwards Confirmed to the King for life. No contrary practiſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Ed. 3 and Q Mary</note> have ſometimes bin granted to Noble men, ſometimes to Merchants to be diſpoſed for that uſe. Afterward they were granted to the King for life, and ſo continued for divers deſcents, yet ſtill as a gift and grant of the Commons.</p>
            <p>Betwixt the time of <hi>Ed.</hi> the third, and Q. <hi>Mary,</hi> never Prince (that he could remember) offered to demand any impoſition, but by gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in <hi>Parliament:</hi> Q. <hi>Mary</hi> laid a charge upon cloth, by the equity of the Statute of Tunnage &amp; Poundage, becauſe the rate ſet upon wool was much more than upon cloth, &amp; there being little wool carried <note place="margin">Pretended equity for the Cuſtome upon cloth.</note> out of the Kingdom unwrought, the Q. thought ſhe had reaſon, to lay ſomwhat more, yet not ful ſo much, as brought them to an equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, but that there ſtil continued a leſſe charge upon wool wrought <note place="margin">The grounds of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termitted Cuſtome.</note> into cloth, than upon wool carried out unwrought; until K. <hi>Jame's</hi> times, when upon <hi>Nicholſons</hi> project, there was a further addition of charge, but ſtill upon pretence of the Statute, which is that we call the pretermitted cuſtome.</p>
            <p>In Q. <hi>Eliz.</hi> time, one or two litle impoſitions crept in, the general <note place="margin">Bates Caſe.</note> proſperity of her raign overſhadowing ſmall errours and innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: one of theſe was upon Currans, by occaſion of the Merchants complaints, that the <hi>Venetians</hi> had laid a charge upon the <hi>Engliſh</hi> cloth, that ſo we might be even with them, and force them the ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to take it off: this being demanded by K. <hi>Iames,</hi> was denied by one <hi>Bates</hi> a Merchant, and upon a ſuit in the Exchequer, was <note place="margin">The judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in for the King.</note> adjudged for the King.</p>
            <p>The manner of which judgement was thus: There were then but three Indges, in that Court, all differing from one another in the grounds of their ſentences. The firſt was of opinion, the King might

impoſe upon ſuch commodities as were forraigne, and ſuperſluous <note place="margin">Reſulting from diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Iudges.</note> as Currans were, but not upon ſuch as were native, and to be tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſported, or neceſſary, and to be imported for the uſe of the kingdom. The ſecond Iudge was of opinion, he might impoſe upon all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Merchandiſe, whether ſuperſluous orno, but not upon native. The third, that for as much as the King had the cuſtody of the Ports and the guard of the Seas, and that he might open and ſhut up the ports as he pleaſed, he had a prerogative to impoſe upon all Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſe, both exported and imported.</p>
            <p>This ſingle, diſtracted &amp; divided judgement, is the foundation of <note place="margin">The only foundation of the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of impo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſing.</note> all the impoſitions now in practice<hi>:</hi> for after this, K. <hi>Iam.</hi> laid new charges upon all commodities outward and inward, not limited to a certaine time, and occaſion, but reſerved to himſelfe, his heires and ſucceſſors for ever; the firſt, impoſitions in fee ſimple, that were <note place="margin">followed with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, and preſerved by breaches of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</note> ever heard of in this kingdome. This judgement, and the right of impoſing thereupon aſlumed was a queſtion in <hi>ſeptimo &amp; duodeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo</hi> of that King, and was the cauſe of the breach of both thoſe <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments,</hi> In 18. and 21. <hi>Jacobi,</hi> it was declined by this Houſe, that they might preſerve the favour of the K. for the diſpatch of ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther great buſineſſes, upon w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> they were more eſpecially attentive.</p>

            <p n="4">4 Theſe burdens are ſo exceſſive, that trade is thereby very much <note place="margin">The bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive.</note> hindered, the commodities of our owne, groweth extreamly aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and thoſe imported much inhaunſed, all which lies not upon the Merchant alone, but upon the generality of the ſubject, and by this meanes the ſtocke of the Kingdom is much diminiſht, our exporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being leſſe proſitable, and our importation more chargeable. And if the warres and troubles in the neighbour parts had not brought almoſt the whole ſtreame of Trade into this Kingdom, we ſhould have found many more prejudicial effects of theſe impoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, long before this time, than yet we have done; eſpecially they <note place="margin">To the Ame<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rican plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeciall.</note> have been inſupportable to the poore plantations, whither many of his Majeſties ſubjects have been transported, in divers parts of the Continent, and Iſtands of <hi>America,</hi> being a deſigne tending to the honout of the Kingdome, and the inlargement of his Majeſties do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions: The adventurers in this noble worke, have for the moſt part, no other ſupport but Tobacco, upon which, ſuch a heavy rate is ſet, that the King receives twice as much, as the true value of the commoditie to the owner.</p>
            <p n="5">5 Whereas theſe great burdens have cauſed divers Merchants <note place="margin">Impoſitions upon trade intercour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſory.</note> to apply themſelves to a way of traſſique abroad by tranſporting goods from one Country to another, without bringing them home into <hi>England.</hi> It hath been lately endeavoured to ſet an Impoſition upon this trade: ſo as the King will have a duty out of thoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities which never came within his dominions, to the great diſcouragement of ſuch active and induſtrious men.</p>
            <p>The next generall head of Civill grievances, was inforcing men <note place="margin">Compoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for Knighthood</note> to compound for Knighthood, which though it may ſeeme paſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is divers years ſince it was uſed, yet upon the ſame grounds the King may renew it, as often as he pleaſeth, for the compoſition lookes backward, and the offence continuing, is ſubiect to a new fine.

that ſuch as were to do Knights ſervice, after they came of age, and had poſſeſſion of their lands, and ſhould be made Knights, that is, publikely declared, to be fit for that ſervice, divers ceremonies and ſolemnities were in uſe for this purpoſe; and if by the parties neglect this was not done, he was puniſhable by Fine: there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in thoſe times an ordinary and open way to get Knighthood, for thoſe who were borne to it.</p>

               </gap>hough the uſe of this hath for divers ages been diſcontinued, yet there have paſt very few Kings, under whom there hath not bin <note place="margin">An old grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance in the kind,</note> a general Summons, requiring thoſe who had lands of ſuch value as the Law preſcribes, to appeare at the Coronation, or ſome other great ſolemnity, and to be Knighted, and yet nothing intended but <note place="margin">New in the manner and exceſſe,</note> the getting of ſome ſmall fines: ſo as this grievance is not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther new in the kind, though it be new in the manner, and in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of it, and that in divers reſpects.</p>
            <p>1 Firſt, It hath been extended beyond all intention of and colour of law, not only Inne-holders, but likewiſe Leaſe-holders, Copy-holders, Merchants and others, ſcarce any man free from it. <note place="margin">Reſpect of</note>

            <p>3 The proceedings have been without any example, preſident, or rule of juſtice: for though thoſe that were ſummoned did appeare, <note place="margin">Greatneſſe of fines.

            <p>3 The third was, the great Inundation of Monopolies, whereby heavy burthens are laid, not only upon forraigne, but alſo native <note place="margin">Monopolies introduced by the ſope pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken by papiſts.</note> commodities.

Amongſt the infinite inconveniences and <note place="margin">Full of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheife.</note> miſchiefes which this did produce, theſe few may be obſerved.</p>
            <p n="1">1 The impairing the goodneſſe, and inhancing the price of moſt <note place="margin">1 the price of commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſt and goodneſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated, Reſtraint of trade.</note> of the Commodities and Manufactures of the Realme, yea of thoſe, who are of moſt neceſſary and common uſe, as Salt, Sope, Beere, Coles, and infinite others.</p>
            <p n="2">2 That under colour of Licences, Trades, and Manufactures are reſtrained to a few hands, and many of the Subjects deprived of

            <p n="4">4 The fourth, that great and unparalleld grievance of the Shipmoney, which though it may ſeeme to have more warrant of Law than the reſt, becauſe there hath a judgement paſt for it, yet in truth it is thereby aggravated, if it be conſidered, that <note place="margin">Aggravated not ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Iudgement. Which is not grounded upon any law cuſtom preſident or author<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Many expreſſe Laws, many Declarations in <hi>Parliaments,</hi> and the conſtant judgment and practiſe of all times being againſt it, yea in the nature of it, it will be found to be diſproportionable to the caſe of neceſſity which is pretended to be the ground of it.</p>
            <p>Neceſſity excludes all formalities and ſolemnities, it is no <note place="margin">The courſe unproper for a caſe of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity.</note> time then to make Levies and Taxes to build and prepare Ships, every mans perſon, every mans Ships are to be imployed for the reſiſting of an invading enemy: the right on the Subjects part was ſo cleare, and the pretences againſt it ſo weake, that hee thought no man would venture his reputation or conſcience in the defence of that judgment, being ſo contrary to the grounds of the Law, to the practiſe of former times, and ſo inconſiſtent <note place="margin">Abounding in variety of miſchiefes.</note> in it ſelfe. Amongſt many inconveniences and obloquies of this grievance he noted theſe.</p>
            <p>1 That it extendeth to all perſons, and to all times, it ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected <note place="margin">The general extent and remedileſſe condition,</note> our goods to diſtreſſe, and our perſons to impriſonment, and the cauſes of it being ſecret and inviſible, referred to his Majeſties breſt alone, the Subject was left without poſſibility of exception, and reliefe.</p>
            <p>2 That there was no rules or limits for the proportion, ſo that <note place="margin">Arbitrary proportion.</note> no man knew what eſtate he had, or how to order his courſe or expences.</p>
            <p>3 That it was taken out of the Subjects purſe, by a writ, and <note place="margin">Impoſed by writ diſpoſ'd by inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> brought into the Kings Coffers by inſtructions from the Lords of his moſt honourable privy Councell. In the legall defence of it, the Writ only did appeare; of the inſtructions, there was no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice taken, which yet in the reall execution of it, were moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant. It carryes the face of ſervice in the Writ, and of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue in the inſtructions<hi>:</hi> if this way had not been found to turn the Ship, into money, it would eaſily have appeared how incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:102464:10"/>
this ſervice is with the office of a Sheriffe, in the inland <note place="margin">Improper for the Sheriffes:</note> Counties, and how incongruous and inconvenient for the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants. The law in a body politike is of like nature, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes prepareth and diſpoſeth proper and ſit inſtruments and Organs, for every naturall operation; if the Law had intended <note place="margin">Vnprovided for by law.</note> any ſuch charge as this, there ſhould have beene certaine rules, ſuitable meanes and courſes, for the levying and managing of it.</p>
            <p>5 The fift was the Inlargement of the Forreſts beyond the <note place="margin">Inlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Forreſts.</note> bounds and perambulations appointed and ſtabliſhed by act of Parliament, twenty ſeven and twenty eight <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>firſt,</hi> and that this is done upon the ſame reaſons and exceptions <note place="margin">Againſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes.</note> which had beene on the Kings part propounded, and by the Commons anſwered in Parliament, not long after that eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment. It is not unknowne to many in this Houſe, that thoſe perambulations were the fruit and effect of that famous Charter, which is called <hi>Charta de forreſta,</hi> whereby many tumults, trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, <note place="margin">Charta de forreſta, made uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe.</note> and diſcontents had beene taken away, and compoſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the King and his ſubjects, &amp; it is ful of danger, that by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving thoſe old Queſtions we may fal into the like diſtſtempers.</p>
            <p>He ſaid, that hereby no blame could fall upon that great Lord <note place="margin">Iuſtice in Eyer clered</note> who is now Iuſtice of Eyre, and in whoſe name theſe things were acted, it ſhould not be expected that he ſhould take notice of the lawes and cuſtomes of the realme, therefore he was careful <note place="margin">The Anſwer lies upon the Iudges.</note> to procure the aſſiſtance and direction of the Iudges, and if any thing were done againſt law, it was for them to anſwer, and not for him.</p>
            <p>The particular irregularities and obliquities of this buſineſſe <note place="margin">Particular obliquities.</note> were theſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1 The ſurreptitious procuring a verdict for the King, without <note place="margin">Surreptiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings.</note> giving notice to the Countrey, whereby they might be prepared to give in evidence for their owne intereſt and indemnity; as was done in <hi>Eſſex.</hi>

In <hi>France</hi> not long ſince, upon a ſurvey of the Kings Revenue, it was found that two parts in three, never came to the Kings purſe, but were diverted to the profit of the officers or Miniſters of the Crowne, and it was thought a very good ſervice and reformation, to reduce two parts to the King, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſtill a third part to the Inſtruments as were imployed about getting it i<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The King hath reſerved upon this Monopoly of Wines, 30 thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Pound Rent a yeere, the Vintner pales 40.

Tunne brought in yeerely, amounts to 3. hundred 60. thouſand pounds, which is 3. hundred and 30. thouſand pounds loſſe to the Kingdome, above the Kings Rent; other Monopolies, as that of Soape, have been very charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the kingdome, and brought very little Treaſure into his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Coffers.</p>
            <p>The Law provides for that revenue of the Crowne; which is
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:102464:13"/>
Naturall and proper, that it may be ſafely collected, and brought to Account, but this illegall Revenue; being without any ſuch provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, is left to hazard, and much uncertainty, either not to be retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, or not duly accounted of.</p>
            <p n="6">6 It is apt to weaken the Induſtry and Courage of the Subject, if <note place="margin">By weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry and courage of the ſubject.</note> they be left uncertain: whether they ſhall reap the benefit of their own paines, and hazard thoſe who are brought into the Condition of ſlaves, will eaſily grow to a ſlaviſh diſpoſition, who having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to loſe, doe commonly ſhew more boldneſſe in diſturbing, than in defending a kingdome.</p>

They have a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting, transforming power that turnes other diſeaſes and evill af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of mens bodies into their own nature.</p>

upon the will and diſpoſition of our Neighbours, but upon our owne ſtrength and Proviſion; Betwixt States there are often ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den changes, from peace to warre, according to occaſion and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. All the States of Chriſtendome are now Arm'd, and we have no reaſon to beleeve, but that thoſe of greateſt Power have an evill Eye upon us in reſpect of our Religion: And if their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Differences ſhould be compoſed, how dangerouſly, how ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily might thoſe great Armies and other Preparations now ready, be applied to ſome Enterpriſe and Attempt againſt us? and if there were no other Cauſe, this were ſufficient to make us ſtand upon our Guard; but there are divers more eſpeciall ſymptomes of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of this kind.</p>
            <p>We may perceive by ſeverall Advertiſements from abroad, that they did fore-ſee our dangers many Moneths before they broke out; they could fore-tell the Time and Manner of them, which is a cleare Evidence, they held Intelligence with thoſe which were the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivers and workers of the preſent troubles.</p>
            <p>We have many dangerous Traytors and Fugitives now in other parts, who can diſcover the weakneſſe and diſtemper of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; who hold Intelligence with the ill-affected party here, and by all cunning and ſubtill practiſes endeavour to incite and provoke other Princes againſtus.</p>
            <p>Some of the Miniſters of our neighbour Princes may be juſtly ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected to have had a more immediate hand &amp; operation in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection and Rebellion of <hi>Ireland,</hi> many of the Commanders and moſt of the Souldiers levied for the ſervice of <hi>Spain</hi> are now joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the Rebels there: and thoſe <hi>Iriſh</hi> Friars which were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed by the Spaniſh Ambaſſador for the making of thoſe Levies, are known to have bin chief Incendiaries to this Rebellion, and are ſtill very active in the proſecution and encouragement of it.</p>
            <p>The Rebels have a ready and ſpeedy ſupply from ſome of our Neighbours. Two Convoyes of Munition and Armes wee are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly informed of: one from <hi>Dunkirk;</hi> the other from <hi>Nantes</hi> in <hi>Britany:</hi> and certainly thoſe that are ſo forward to enable others to hurt us, will not forbeare to hurt us themſelves, aſſoone as they ſhall have means und opportunity to do it.</p>
            <p>Another danger is from the Papiſts and ill-affected Parties at home. The Papiſts here are acted by the ſame Principles with thoſe in <hi>Ireland;</hi> many of the moſt active of them have lately beene there; which argues an intercourſe &amp; communication of Counſels.

They have ſtill ſtore of Armes and Munition at their diſpoſing, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all our endeavours to diſarm them, they have a free re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort to the Citie and to the Court, they want no opportunities to conſult together; they have the ſame or greater incouragements from above, and from about them, then ever, in reſpect of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample and ſucceſſe of the Rebels in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the great confuſions and diviſions which by their cunning and ſubtill practiſes are raiſed and fomented amongſt our ſelves at home.</p>
            <p>3. A third danger is of Tumults and Inſurrections of the meaner ſort of people, by reaſon of their ill vent of Cloth and other Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures, whereby great multitudes are ſet on work, who live for the moſt part by their daily gettings, &amp; will in a very ſhort time be brought to great extremity, if not imployed; nothing is more ſharp and preſſing then neceſſity and want; what they cannot buy they will take, and from them the like neceſſity will quickly be derived to the Farmours and Husbandmen; and ſo grow higher, &amp; involve all in an equality of miſery and diſtreſſe, if it be not prevented. And at this time ſuch Tumults will be dangerous, becauſe the Kingdom is full of disbanded Souldiers and Officers which will be ready to head and to animate the Multitude to commit violence with more ſtrength and advantage, and if they once grow into a Body, it will be much more difficult to reduce them into order again, becauſe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity and want, which are the Cauſes of this diſturbance, will ſtill encreaſe as the effects doe encreaſe.</p>
            <p>4. A fourth danger is from the Rebels in <hi>Ireland,</hi> not only in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of that Kingdom, but in reſpect of this. They have ſeized upon the Body of that Kingdom already, they abound in men of very able bodies, they encreaſe in Armes and Munition, they have great hopes of ſupplies from abroad, of encouragement here, and are ſure of good entertainment from the Popiſh party, ſo that they begin to ſpeak already of the tranſporting themſelves hither, and making this Kingdom the ſeat of the warre.</p>
            <p>The diſtemper which hath produced theſe dangers is various and <note place="margin">2 The di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper procuring the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.</note> exceeding violent Whenſoever nature is hindred in her proper ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations and faculties, diſtempers will neceſſarily follow.</p>
            <p>The obſtructions which have brought us into this diſtemper are very many, ſo that we cannot wonder at the ſtrength and maligni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of it. Some of the chiefeſt of theſe obſtructions I ſhall endeavour to remember.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The obſtruction of Reformation in matters of Religion. No
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:102464:21"/>
grievances are ſharper then thoſe that preſſe upon the tender conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of men; and that there was never Church or State afflicted with more grievances of this kind, then we have bin. And though they are by the wiſedom of this Parliament partly caſed and dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, yet many ſtill remaine: and as long as the Biſhops and the corrupt part of the Clergie continue in their Power, there will be little hope of freedome either from the ſence of thoſe which conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, or the feare of thoſe which are removed. And of this obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, (my Lords) I muſt clear the Commons, we are in no part guilty of it: ſome good Bils have paſt us, and others are in preparation, which had bin paſt before this, if wee had not found ſuch ill ſucceſſe in the other. Whatſoever miſchiefe this obſtruction ſhall produce, we are free from it: wee may have our part of the Miſerie, we can have no part in the <hi>guilt</hi> or diſhonour.</p>
            <p n="2">2. An obſtruction in Trade. It is the Trade that brings food and nouriſhment to the Kingdom, It is that which preſerves &amp; encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the ſtock of the whole, and diſtributes a convenient Portion of maintenance to every part of it: therefore ſuch an obſtruction as this muſt be dangerous; the Freedom of Trades being ſo neceſſary, the benefit ſo important, as that it gives life, ſtrength, and beauty to the whole Body of the Common-wealth: but I muſt proteſt the Houſe of Commons hath given no Cauſe to this obſtruction; wee have cas'd Trade of many Burdens, and heavy Taxes which are taken off; we have freed it from many hard reſtraints by Pattents and Mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polies; we have bin willing to part with our own Priviledges, to give it encouragement; We have ſought to put the Merchants into ſecurity and confidence in reſpect of the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> that ſo they might be invited to bring in their Bullion to the Mint as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore they have done: and wee are no way guilty of the Troubles, the feares, and publique dangers which make men withdraw their Stocks, and to keep their money by them, to be ready for ſuch ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Exigents, as in theſe great diſtractions we have too much Cauſe to expect.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The obſtruction in the Reliefe of <hi>Ireland.</hi> It muſt needs be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compted a great ſhame and diſhonour to this Kingdom, that our Neighbours have ſhewed themſelves more forward to ſupply the Rebels, then we have bin to relieve our diſtreſſed brethren and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-Subjects. But I muſt declare that we are altogether innocent of any neglect herein. As ſoon as the firſt newes of the Rebellion came over, we undertook the War, not by way of Supply and Ayd, as in
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:102464:22"/>
former Rebellions the Subjects have uſed to doe, but we undertook the whole charge of it, and we ſuffered not foure and twenty houres to paſſe, before we agreed to a great Leavy of Money and Men, to be imployed againſt the Rebells, even in a larger proportion then the Lord Juſtices and Councell there did deſire: and from time to time we have done all for the furtherance thereof, though in the midſt of many diſtractions and diverſions, but the want of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions for leavying Men, for iſſuing Armes, and divers other Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments, have bin the Cauſes of that obſtruction; and I wiſh we had not only found Impediments to our ſelves, but alſo Incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to them. Many of the chiefe Commanders, now in the Head of the Rebels, after we had with your Lordſhips Concurrence ſtopt the Ports againſt all <hi>Iriſh</hi> Papiſts, have beene ſuffered to paſſe by his Majeſties immediate Warrant, much to the diſcouragement of the Lord juſtices and the Councell there; and, this procured, as we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, by ſome evill Inſtruments, too neere his Regall Perſon, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his Majeſties knowledge and intention.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The obſtruction in proſecution of Delinquents: many wee have already brought up to your Lordſhips, divers others we have bin diſcouraged to tranſmit; ſuch difficult proceedings have we met withall; ſuch terrors and diſcountenance have beene caſt upon our ſelves and our witneſſes; and thoſe who have ſhewed themſelves, their friends, and Patrons, have found it the moſt ready way to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment; yea, his Majeſties own hand hath bin obtained, his Majeſties Ships imployed for the tranſporting of divers of thoſe who have fled from the Juſtice of the Parliament.</p>
            <p n="5">5. A generall obſtruction &amp; interruption of the proceedings of Parliament, by thoſe manifold deſignes of violence (which through Gods mercy we have eſcaped;) by the great and frequent breaches of Priviledge; by the ſubtill endevours to raiſe parties in our Houſe, and jealouſies betwixt the two Houſes.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The obſtruction in providing for the Defence of the Kingdom, that we might be inabled to reſiſt a forraign Enemy, to ſuppreſſe all Civill Inſurrections: and what a preſſing neceſſity there is of this, the exceeding great decayes in the Novie, in the Forts, in the Power of ordering the <hi>Militia</hi> of the Kingdom, and Means of furniſhing them with Munition, are ſufficient evidences, known to none bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then to your Lordſhips, and what endeavour we have uſed to remove them (but hitherto without that ſucceſſe and concurrence which we expected:) and where the ſtop hath bin, and upon what
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:102464:22"/>
good grounds we may claime our own innocency and faithfulneſſe in this, we deſire no other Witneſſes but your ſelves.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, I come to the evill Influences which have cauſed this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper, and I ſhall content my ſelfe to mention ſome few of thoſe which are moſt Apparent and Important.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In the firſt place, I ſhall remember the evill Councells about <note place="margin">3 The <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences</hi> that have cauſed ſo great <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper.</hi>
               </note> the King, whereof wee have often complained. Diſeaſes of the Braine are moſt dangerous, becauſe from thence Sence and Motion are derived to the whole Body. The malignity of evill Councells will quickly be infuſed into all parts of the State. None can doubt but we have exceedingly laboured under moſt dangerous and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous Councells. This evill Influence hath bin the cauſe of the preparation of Warre with <hi>Scotland,</hi> of the procuring a Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in <hi>Ireland,</hi> of corrupting Religion, ſuppreſſing the Liberty of this Kingdome, and of many fearefull and horrid Attempts, to the ſubverting the very being of Parliament, which was the only hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Meanes of oppoſing and preventing all the reſt: And this doth appeare to be a moſt predominant evill of the Time; whereat we need not wonder, when wee conſider how Counſellours have beene preferred and prepared. And I appeale to your Lordſhips owne Conſciences, whether the giving, and the countenancing of evill Councell, hath not beene almoſt the only way to favour and advancement.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The diſcouragement of good Councell: divers honeſt and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved Counſellours have bin put from their places: others ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countenanced, as that the way of favour hath bin ſhut againſt them, and that of danger and deſtruction only open to them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The great Power that an interreſſed &amp; factious Party hath in the Parliament, by the continuance of the Votes of the Biſhops and Popiſh Lords in your Lordſhips Houſe; and the taking in of others both out of the Houſe of Commons, and otherwiſe, to enc<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eaſe their ſtrength.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The fomenting and cheriſhing of a malignant Party through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole Kingdom.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The manifold jealouſies betwixt the King, his Parliament, and good Subjects, whereby his protection and favour hath in a great meaſure bin with-held from them: their inclination and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to ſerve and aſſiſt him hath beene very much hindred and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted: We have often ſuffer'd under the miſ-interpretation of good actions, &amp; falſe imputation of evill, which we never intended.
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:102464:23"/>
So that we may juſtly purge our ſelves from all guilt of being Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of this jealouſie and miſunderſtanding: Wee have bin, and are ſtill ready to ſerve his Majeſty with our lives and fortunes, with as much cheerefulneſſe and earneſtneſſe of affection, as ever any Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects were; and we doubt not but our proceedings will ſo manifeſt this, that we ſhall be as cleare in the apprehenſion of the world, as we are in the teſtimony of our own conſciences.</p>
            <p>I am now come to a concluſion, and I have nothing to propound to your Lordſhips by way of Requeſt or deſire from the Houſe of Commons; I doubt not but your judgements will tell you what is to be done; your Conſciences, your Honours, your Intereſts will call upon you for the doing of it; The Commons will be glad to have your help and concurrence in ſaving of the Kingdome; but if they ſhould faile of it, it ſhould not diſcourage them in doing their duty. And whether the Kingdom be loſt or ſaved (as through Gods bleſſing I hope it will be) they ſhall be ſorry that the ſtory of this preſent Parliament ſhould tell Poſterity, that in ſo great a Danger and Extremity, the Houſe of Commons ſhould be enforced to ſave the Kingdome alone, and that the Houſe of Peeres ſhould have no part in the honour of the preſervation of it, you having ſo great an Intereſt in the good ſucceſſe of thoſe endeavours, in reſpect of your great Eſtates, and high degrees of Nobility.</p>
            <p>MY Lords, conſider what the preſent neceſſities and dangers of the Common-wealth require, what the <hi>Commons</hi> have reaſon to expect, to what endeavours and counſels the concurrent deſires of all the people doe invite you: ſo that applying your ſelves to the preſervation of the King and Kingdom, I may be bold to aſſure you in the name of all the <hi>Commons</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> that you ſhall be bravely ſeconded.</p>
